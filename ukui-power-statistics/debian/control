 these complex tasks and only show some settings important to the user.
 .
 The UKUI power manager displays and manages battery status, power plug
 events, display brightness, CPU, graphics card and hard disk drive
 power saving, and can trigger suspend-to-RAM, hibernate or shutdown
 events, all integrated to other components of the UKUI desktop.
